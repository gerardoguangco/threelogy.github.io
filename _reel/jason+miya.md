“I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.”

– Pablo Neruda

To this beautiful couple, and to their awesome families who are self professed alcohol lovers if I may add, may the Patrons and Blue Labels keep flowing just like the love we witnessed from you two on this wonderful day.
